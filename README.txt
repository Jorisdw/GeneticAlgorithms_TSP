MyCrossover is the new crossover operator. It is the order crossover from the textbook on page 73. To use this one you have to select it in the dropdown menu in the gui.
MyMutation is the new mutation operator. It is the insert mutation from page 69 and is the default mutation operator in the program.

I did some testing and it looks like 25% mutation rate and 85% crossover rate are good values. But maybe some more testing is required on the other parameters.
